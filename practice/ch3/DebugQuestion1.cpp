// The following program is supposed to add two numbers, but doesnâ€™t work correctly.
// Use the integrated debugger to step through this program and watch the value of x. Based on the information you learn, fix the following program:

// input 2 and 3 then show The sum is: 3 is incorrect

// because x init 0, first readNumber(x) return 2 but not assign to x
// then second readNumber(x) return 3 but not assign to x
// x = 0 + 3 = 3

// so we should assign the return value of readNumber(x) to x
